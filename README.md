This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

 ### For Styling I ...

# Styled Components with SCSS in Next.js

## 1. Organize my Project Structure

Firstly, make sure your project structure is organized. I typically have folders for components (`components/`) and styles (`styles/`).

## 2. Create SCSS File

Next, I create a SCSS file for styling my components. For example, I might name it `UserProfile.module.scss`.

## 3. Define CSS Classes in SCSS File

Inside the SCSS file, I define CSS classes for styling my components. For instance, I might define `.user-card` for styling a user card component.

## 4. Import SCSS File into Component

I then import the SCSS file into my component file where I want to apply the styles. For example:

```javascript
import Usercard from '../styles/UserProfile.module.scss';

 
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
